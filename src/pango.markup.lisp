;;; Markup
;;;
;;;     Simple markup language for text with attributes
;;;
;;; Functions
;;;
;;;     pango_parse_markup
;;;     pango_markup_parser_new
;;;     pango_markup_parser_finish
;;;
;;; Description
;;;
;;; Frequently, you want to display some text to the user with attributes
;;; applied to part of the text (for example, you might want bold or italicized
;;; words). With the base Pango interfaces, you could create a PangoAttrList and
;;; apply it to the text; the problem is that you'd need to apply attributes to
;;; some numeric range of characters, for example "characters 12-17." This is
;;; broken from an internationalization standpoint; once the text is translated,
;;; the word you wanted to italicize could be in a different position.
;;;
;;; The solution is to include the text attributes in the string to be
;;; translated. Pango provides this feature with a small markup language. You
;;; can parse a marked-up string into the string text plus a PangoAttrList using
;;; either of pango_parse_markup() or pango_markup_parser_new().
;;;
;;; A simple example of a marked-up string might be:
;;;
;;; <span foreground="blue" size="x-large">Blue text</span> is <i>cool</i>!
;;;
;;; Pango uses GMarkup to parse this language, which means that XML features
;;; such as numeric character entities such as &amp;#169; for Â© can be used too.
;;;
;;; The root tag of a marked-up document is <markup>, but pango_parse_markup()
;;; allows you to omit this tag, so you will most likely never need to use it.
;;; The most general markup tag is <span>, then there are some convenience tags.
;;;
;;; Span attributes
;;;
;;; <span> has the following attributes:
;;;
;;; font_desc: A font description string, such as "Sans Italic 12". See
;;; pango_font_description_from_string() for a description of the format of the
;;; string representation . Note that any other span attributes will override
;;; this description. So if you have "Sans Italic" and also a style="normal"
;;; attribute, you will get Sans normal, not italic.
;;;
;;; font_family: A font family name
;;;
;;; font_size, size: Font size in 1024ths of a point, or one of the absolute
;;; sizes xx-small, x-small, small, medium, large, x-large, xx-large, or one of
;;; the relative sizes smaller or larger. If you want to specify a absolute
;;; size, it's usually easier to take advantage of the ability to specify a
;;; partial font description using font; you can use font='12.5' rather than
;;; size='12800'.
;;;
;;; font_style: One of normal, oblique, italic
;;;
;;; font_weight: One of ultralight, light, normal, bold, ultrabold, heavy, or a
;;; numeric weight
;;;
;;; font_variant: One of normal or smallcaps
;;;
;;; font_stretch, stretch: One of ultracondensed, extracondensed, condensed,
;;; semicondensed, normal, semiexpanded, expanded, extraexpanded, ultraexpanded
;;;
;;; font_features: A comma-separated list of OpenType font feature settings, in
;;; the same syntax as accepted by CSS. E.g: font_features='dlig=1, -kern,
;;; afrc on'
;;;
;;; foreground, fgcolor: An RGB color specification such as #00FF00 or a color
;;; name such as red. Since 1.38, an RGBA color specification such as #00FF007F
;;; will be interpreted as specifying both a foreground color and foreground
;;; alpha.
;;;
;;; background, bgcolor: An RGB color specification such as #00FF00 or a color
;;; name such as red. Since 1.38, an RGBA color specification such as #00FF007F
;;; will be interpreted as specifying both a background color and background
;;; alpha.
;;;
;;; alpha, fgalpha: An alpha value for the foreground color, either a plain
;;; integer between 1 and 65536 or a percentage value like 50%.
;;;
;;; background_alpha, bgalpha: An alpha value for the background color, either
;;; a plain integer between 1 and 65536 or a percentage value like 50%.
;;;
;;; underline: One of none, single, double, low, error, single-line, double-line
;;; or error-line.
;;;
;;; underline_color: The color of underlines; an RGB color specification such as
;;; #00FF00 or a color name such as red
;;;
;;; overline: One of none or single
;;;
;;; overline_color: The color of overlines; an RGB color specification such as
;;; #00FF00 or a color name such as red
;;;
;;; rise: Vertical displacement, in Pango units. Can be negative for subscript,
;;; positive for superscript.
;;;
;;; strikethrough true or false whether to strike through the text
;;;
;;; strikethrough_color: The color of strikethrough lines; an RGB color
;;; specification such as #00FF00 or a color name such as red
;;;
;;; fallback: true or false whether to enable fallback. If disabled, then
;;; characters will only be used from the closest matching font on the system.
;;; No fallback will be done to other fonts on the system that might contain the
;;; characters in the text. Fallback is enabled by default. Most applications
;;; should not disable fallback.
;;;
;;; allow_breaks: true or false whether to allow line breaks or not. If not
;;; allowed, the range will be kept in a single run as far as possible. Breaks
;;; are allowed by default.
;;;
;;; insert_hyphens: true or false` whether to insert hyphens when breaking lines
;;; in the middle of a word. Hyphens are inserted by default.
;;;
;;; show: A value determining how invisible characters are treated. Possible
;;; values are spaces, line-breaks, ignorables or combinations, such as
;;; spaces|line-breaks.
;;;
;;; lang: A language code, indicating the text language
;;;
;;; letter_spacing: Inter-letter spacing in 1024ths of a point.
;;;
;;; gravity: One of south, east, north, west, auto.
;;;
;;; gravity_hint: One of natural, strong, line.
;;;
;;; Convenience tags
;;;
;;; The following convenience tags are provided:
;;;
;;; <b>: Bold
;;; <big>: Makes font relatively larger, equivalent to <span size="larger">
;;; <i>: Italic
;;; <s>: Strikethrough
;;; <sub>: Subscript
;;; <sup>: Superscript
;;; <small>: Makes font relatively smaller, equivalent to <span size="smaller">
;;; <tt>: Monospace
;;; <u>: Underline
